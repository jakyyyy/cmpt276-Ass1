# README FILE FOR GRADE CALCULATOR


In this assignment, I built a webpage for the grade calculator. Basically, users need to input the grades, and then the system will automatically calculate the mean, average, min, and max values for users. The system also considers the situation when there is no input for some of the fields; then there will be a warning of "invalid input value", and the system will discard the invaild data, and calculate the results with rest of the valid data. The details can be test through my webpage.
